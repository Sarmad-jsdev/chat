### Tips for Drawing Using These Tables

- Use actor colors (Green, Blue, Orange, Purple) outside the rectangle.  
- Main use case ellipses → same color as actor.  
- Sub-use cases → lighter shade of the same color, connected to main use case.  
- **Include relationships** → dashed arrow pointing to sub-use case.  
- **Extend relationships** → dashed arrow pointing from base to extended case.  
- System processes (Gray) → place inside system boundary but separate from actor-related use cases.
