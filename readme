## Tips for Drawing
- Use **actor colors** (Green, Blue, Orange, Purple) outside the system rectangle.
- Main use case ellipses → same color as actor.
- Sub-use cases → lighter shade of the same color, connected to main use case.
- **<<include>> relationships** → dashed arrow pointing to sub-use case.
- **<<extend>> relationships** → dashed arrow pointing from base to extended case.
- **System processes (Gray)** → place inside system boundary but separate from actor-related use cases.
